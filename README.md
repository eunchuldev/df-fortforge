# Where to play?

# Why made DF FortForge?

This is how I enjoy Dwarf Fortress: Pause immediately after the game starts. Design the entire fort over several hours. The fort looks aesthetically pleasing, functionally flawless, and perfectly efficient. Then, when I press the play button, the fortress falls within an hour.

Losing is fun. However, it is a huge pain to test tiny improvements by repeatedly building an entire fort nearly identical to the last run. It is especially true with the unfriendly Dwarf Fortress User Interface.

To recap, I needed an efficient tool to incrementally improve my fortress design without repeating the whole building process.

# Who is DF FortForge for?

- Who tends to prepare and design the fort longer than playing
- Who wants to separate the design and building process of the fortress
- Who wants to design a fortress as if manipulating an image: you can select, copy, paste, rotate, and flip the area.

# What is the limitation of DF FortForge?

- At this moment, it only has four designation targets: dig, ramp, channel, and stairs
- The designation does not reflect the in-game mechanism. For example, it can't detect cave-in
- It has not tested well so might be buggy at this moment

# How it works?

it can generate a DF macro of the given fort design. Then the macro file could be loaded into Dwarf fortress Game.
